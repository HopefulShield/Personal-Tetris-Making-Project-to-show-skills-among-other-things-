# Personal-Tetris-Making-Project-to-show-skills-among-other-things-

As per the title, this mini project was done to make tetris stuff.
Currently in the rough stages but I will later on refine things as it goes as I am still working out the 
major "kinks" of early stage code testing and code making 
Reason for making this mini project was to show off my skill in computer science 
TODO: additional "abilities" and planning to make an ai based on recent course taken
